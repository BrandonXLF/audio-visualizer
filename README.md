# Audio Visualizer
Audio Visualizer is a simple program to view the soundwaves of an entire song or video written in Python 3. The program opens a file containing audio data and graphs it in a line chart with timestamps at the bottom.

## Installation
You can [download the installer](https://github.com/BrandonXLF/audio-visualizer/raw/master/AV%20Installer.exe) or [download the EXE file](https://github.com/BrandonXLF/audio-visualizer/raw/master/dist/Audio%20Visualizer.exe) for portable use.

The [python file](https://github.com/BrandonXLF/audio-visualizer/raw/master/Audio%20Visualizer.py) can also be downloaded for use on other operating systems and other needs. The Python file requires Python 3 to run the file, and FFmpeg is needed in the PATH. The python libarbaries matplotlib (and its dependencies) and numpy (and its dependencies) are also needed.
